Specifically, GLE is an approach based on Matrix Factorization that takes as input non-relational data and outputs node embeddings. The key insight of GLEs is that the graph property to be preserved can be interpreted as pairwise node similarities. Thus, a larger penalty is imposed if two nodes with large similarity are embedded far apart. Thus, the goal of this approach is to find an embedding that minimizes this penalty.\nThe gist of this approach is that it aims to first represent the graph as a Graph Laplacian Matrix, $L$. $L$ is a means of representing a graph in matrix form following the definition $L = D - W$, where $D$ is the degree matrix, a diagonal matrix containing the degree of each node, and $W$ is the adjacency matrix of weights. Under this representation, all positive values correspond to degrees of the node, and all negative values to the weights of the edges. We then perform a decomposition on $L$ to find its eigenvalues. The eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest of the eigenvalues are used as the embedding.\nThe optimal embedding, $y^{\\ast}$ can be derived from the following objective function,\n$$y^{\\ast} = \\text{argmin}_{y} \\sum_{i\\neq j} (y_{i} - y_{j}^{2} W_{ij}) = \\text{argmin}_{y} y^{T}Ly$$\nWhere $W_{ij}$ is the similarity matrix between every pair of nodes $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$. $L$ is the graph laplacian matrix, $D$ is the diagonal matrix for which $D_{ii} = \\sum_{i \\neq j}W_{ij}$.\nThe goal of this objective function is to find the embedding, $y^{\\ast}$ that minimizes the error compared to the Graph Laplacian Matrix, $L$. One benefit of representing a graph with $L$ rather than a simple adjacency matrix is that the diagonal will contain the degrees of the graph; the larger the degree of a node, the more that its row will be \u0026ldquo;weighted\u0026rdquo; when computing the objective function. The practical effect is that larger degree nodes will have a greater impact on the embedding than lower-degree nodes.\nThere are several expansions on this basic optimization, but in each of these variants, the optimal embedding $y^{\\prime}$ are the eigenvectors of the laplacian matrix, $\\lambda$, which can be calculated by solving the the eigenproblem $Wy = \\lambda Dy$.\nArrange the eigenvalues from smallest to largest. The first eigenvalue should be close to zero, and its corresponding eigenvector is not typically used for embedding. Rather, use the remaining eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors to construct the $d$-dimensional embedding. For example, a 3-dimensional embedding can be constructed using the eigenvectors corresponding to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th smallest eigenvalues. A 2-dimensional embedding can be constructed using the eigenvectors of the 2nd and 3rd smallest eigenvalues.\nLets walk through this process in R.\nConsider the Karate network, shown below, which is a popular network exemplifying community structure.\nHaving loaded this data into R, we can construct the Graph Laplacian Matrix, $L$, from the adjacency matrix $W$ and the degree matrix, $D$.\nW \u0026lt;- as.matrix(as.matrix.network(karate)) D \u0026lt;- diag(rowSums(W)) L \u0026lt;- D - W  Then, we can solve the eigenproblem $Wy = \\lambda Dy$ and select the eigenvectors corresponding to the 2nd and 3rd smallest eigenvectors to produce an embedding.\neig \u0026lt;- eigen(L, D) col_dim \u0026lt;- dim(eig$vectors)[1] vectors \u0026lt;- eig$vectors[,(col_dim - 1):(col_dim - 2)]  The resulting embedding is shown below.\nWe can see that much of the structure from the original graph also appears in the embedding. As with the network, the embedding demonstrates a clear division between the two communities. Additionally, we see all the nodes that are directly connected to the opposing community are clustered together. Meanwhile, nodes for Actor 5, 6, 7, 11, and 17 are clustered apart form the other clusters, reflecting their somewhat isolated position in the original graph. Similarly, Actor 12 only maintains one connection to Mr. H, and is thus set far apart from the other nodes in the embedding.\nThere are many uses for graph embeddings. They allow for fast computation of node distances and can serve as effective features for graph-based classification problems.\nThis content was largely drawn from the following resources,\n Cai, H., Zheng, V.

Over the course of the last few decades, these communication vehicles have been increasingly metricized, as one aspect of a general effort to measure, rank, and rate the quality of research. When the Journal Citation Reports was first published as an addendum to the 1975 Science Citation Index, it suggested using aggregated citation metrics – as indicators of journal use – to inform librarians in collection management decisions, while the detailed citation network data could aid scholars at the intersection of fields to find publication venues. Over time a single indicator from the JCR, the Journal Impact Factor (JIF) moved out of the library context, and has increasingly been applied not only to assess journals, but also to assess and to predict the performance of documents and associated authors within journals. This extensive misapplication of JIF and other journal indicators has spurred increased scrutiny of the construction and use of journal metrics, evidenced by the growing number of declarations and manifestos asking either for these indicators to be used responsibly, or for them to be eliminated from processes of research assessment.\n\nTo contribute to the conversation around the construction and use of journal indicators, we convened a diverse group of stakeholders—metric providers, funders, evaluation agencies, administrators, publishers, editors, librarians, scientometricians, researchers, and readers/users of scholarly publications—for a one-week workshop hosted jointly by the Lorentz Center, the Centre for Science and Technology Studies at Leiden University (CWTS), and Clarivate Analytics. The workshop, entitled “Rethinking Impact Factors: New Pathways in Journal Metrics” focused on indicators for scholarly journals. It was not restricted to citation-based indicators, but examined a broad array of current and potential indicators at the journal level.\n\nOur discussion began with an enumeration of the scholarly functions of journals. This provides a foundation on which to build a typology of indicators grounded in these functions, which in turn is based on the belief that journal indicators should serve to strengthen and reinforce the primary functions of the journal. At present, citation-based indicators are the most widely used and promoted journal indicators; we contend that broadening the scope of journal indicators to match the multi-dimensional roles of journals should lead to a more responsible evaluation framework, in which values such as diversity, transparency, and reliability are considered an integral part of scholarly research and impact. Further, we provide principles for the construction and the use of journal indicators. These principles are essential to ensure that a proliferation of metrics does not distort the scholarly communication system, but leads to more granular and transparent assessments. We sought to relate ideals of fairness and openness in journal indicators to the practical realities of those who generate and use them. We end with a set of recommendations and further actions.","tags":["Journal Impact Factors","Workshop"],"title":"Rethinking journal impact factors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cassidy R.
