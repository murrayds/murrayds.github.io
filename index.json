Ideally, a researcher should be evaluated based on their true merit, but evaluation is subjective, and deeply embedded in a particular social, political, and cultural context. In my research, I explore what social and contextual factors relate to evaluation in science. I conduct four studies examining different areas of evaluation. The first study, focusing on peer review, examines the extent to which gender and national bias persist in journal peer review at eLife. The next studies investigate how bias and contextual factors shape two very different kinds of performance metrics: the first examines how demographic factors such as gender and ethnicity relate to student evaluations of teachers, whereas the latter explores how the use of disagreement citations differs across fields, and how this might necessitate more nuanced understandings of citation-based metrics. Finally, I turn towards evaluative networks; specifically, I focus on how networks of mobility, which are both driven by evaluation, and can drive a researcher's future success, are not equally available to everyone. I use a neural embedding technique to encode millions of researcher's individual trajectories into a vector-space representation which, when interrogated, reveals the importance of geography, language, culture, prestige, and more, in structuring global mobility, and thus the options available to individual researchers. Together, these studies paint a picture of how social and contextual factors shape evaluation, and therefore success, in science. Changes to policies and practices are necessary to remedy these issues and promote holistic evaluation, and to create a more equitable, open, and effective system of science.","tags":[],"title":"2021 Northwestern","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Dakota Murray"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1608071492,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608071492,"objectID":"511deb46915b64b588573ce5f524bce9","permalink":"/talk/2020-northeastern/","publishdate":"2020-12-15T17:31:32-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-northeastern/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Job"],"title":"2021 Northwestern","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Dakota Murray","Wout Lamers","Vincent Lariviére","Kevin Boyack","Cassidy R.

However, in the crowded arena of online platforms, it is increasingly important for scientists to present their findings in a manner that appears credible, especially considering the heightened opportunity for the misunderstandings surrounding scientific topics, such as climate change. To examine the extent to which the online presentation of science information relates to its perceived credibility, we designed and conducted two surveys on Amazon’s Mechanical Turk. In the first survey, participants rated the credibility of science information on Twitter compared with the same information other platforms, and in the second, participants rated the credibility of tweets with modified characteristics: presence of an image, text sentiment, number of likes/retweets. We found that that the same information about scientific findings was generally found less credible when presented on Twitter than on other platforms. However, there is evidence that even within Twitter, the inclusion of recognizable features of Scientific work, such as figures, the paper abstract, and the use of the paper title, may be related to increased credibility on Twitter. A clear understanding of features that contribute to and detract from credibility on a platform as widely distrusted as Twitter may allow researchers who regularly use Twitter for research-related networking and communication to present their findings in the most credible formats.","tags":null,"title":"Credibility of Scientific Information on Social Media: Variation by Platform and Presence of Formal Credibility Cues","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacqueline Brown","Dakota Murray","Kyle Furlong","Emily Coco","Fabian Dablander"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"4a9171d31926153b97df8fefea9d59b4","permalink":"/publication/brown-breeding-2020/","publishdate":"2020-07-21T15:31:06.558821Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brown-breeding-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Interdisciplinary research is essential for the study of complex systems, and so there is a growing need to understand the factors that facilitate collaboration across diverse fields of study. In this exploratory research, we examine the formation of self-organized project groups and the structure of collaboration networks at the Santa Fe Institute's Complex Systems Summer School. Using data from all iterations of the summer school from 2005 to 2019, comprising 779 participants and 304 projects, we investigate the factors influencing group formation. We find that group formation at the Summer School based on gender, position, affiliation, country of study, and discipline is largely consistent with random mixing. Similarly, using standard network measurements, we find that no single discipline is more prone to interdisciplinary collaboration than any other; nor do participants from any particular discipline exert stronger influence in the network. While our results point to a high degree of interdisciplinary collaboration overall, project topics from the social and behavioral sciences are significantly over-represented. This could be due to a higher level of baseline interest in, or knowledge of, social and behavioral sciences, or the common application of methods from the natural sciences to topics in the social sciences. Consequently, future research should explore this discrepancy further and examine whether it can be mitigated through policies aimed at making topics in other disciplines more accessible or appealing for collaboration.","tags":null,"title":"A Breeding Pool of Ideas: Analyzing Interdisciplinary Collaborations at the Complex Systems Summer School","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dakota Murray"],"categories":[],"content":"Graph laplacian eigenmaps (GLE) are one means, among many, of embedding graphs into a low-dimensional numeric space. Specifically, GLE is an approach based on Matrix Factorization that takes as input non-relational data and outputs node embeddings. The key insight of GLEs is that the graph property to be preserved can be interpreted as pairwise node similarities. Thus, a larger penalty is imposed if two nodes with large similarity are embedded far apart. Thus, the goal of this approach is to find an embedding that minimizes this penalty.\nThe gist of this approach is that it aims to first represent the graph as a Graph Laplacian Matrix, $L$. $L$ is a means of representing a graph in matrix form following the definition $L = D - W$, where $D$ is the degree matrix, a diagonal matrix containing the degree of each node, and $W$ is the adjacency matrix of weights. Under this representation, all positive values correspond to degrees of the node, and all negative values to the weights of the edges. We then perform a decomposition on $L$ to find its eigenvalues. The eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest of the eigenvalues are used as the embedding.\nThe optimal embedding, $y^{\\ast}$ can be derived from the following objective function,\n$$y^{\\ast} = \\text{argmin}_{y} \\sum_{i\\neq j} (y_{i} - y_{j}^{2} W_{ij}) = \\text{argmin}_{y} y^{T}Ly$$\nWhere $W_{ij}$ is the similarity matrix between every pair of nodes $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$. $L$ is the graph laplacian matrix, $D$ is the diagonal matrix for which $D_{ii} = \\sum_{i \\neq j}W_{ij}$.\nThe goal of this objective function is to find the embedding, $y^{\\ast}$ that minimizes the error compared to the Graph Laplacian Matrix, $L$. One benefit of representing a graph with $L$ rather than a simple adjacency matrix is that the diagonal will contain the degrees of the graph; the larger the degree of a node, the more that its row will be \u0026ldquo;weighted\u0026rdquo; when computing the objective function. The practical effect is that larger degree nodes will have a greater impact on the embedding than lower-degree nodes.\nThere are several expansions on this basic optimization, but in each of these variants, the optimal embedding $y^{\\prime}$ are the eigenvectors of the laplacian matrix, $\\lambda$, which can be calculated by solving the the eigenproblem $Wy = \\lambda Dy$.\nArrange the eigenvalues from smallest to largest. The first eigenvalue should be close to zero, and its corresponding eigenvector is not typically used for embedding. Rather, use the remaining eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors to construct the $d$-dimensional embedding. For example, a 3-dimensional embedding can be constructed using the eigenvectors corresponding to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th smallest eigenvalues. A 2-dimensional embedding can be constructed using the eigenvectors of the 2nd and 3rd smallest eigenvalues.\nLets walk through this process in R.\nConsider the Karate network, shown below, which is a popular network exemplifying community structure.\nHaving loaded this data into R, we can construct the Graph Laplacian Matrix, $L$, from the adjacency matrix $W$ and the degree matrix, $D$.\nW \u0026lt;- as.matrix(as.matrix.network(karate)) D \u0026lt;- diag(rowSums(W)) L \u0026lt;- D - W  Then, we can solve the eigenproblem $Wy = \\lambda Dy$ and select the eigenvectors corresponding to the 2nd and 3rd smallest eigenvectors to produce an embedding.\neig \u0026lt;- eigen(L, D) col_dim \u0026lt;- dim(eig$vectors)[1] vectors \u0026lt;- eig$vectors[,(col_dim - 1):(col_dim - 2)]  The resulting embedding is shown below.\nWe can see that much of the structure from the original graph also appears in the embedding. As with the network, the embedding demonstrates a clear division between the two communities. Additionally, we see all the nodes that are directly connected to the opposing community are clustered together. Meanwhile, nodes for Actor 5, 6, 7, 11, and 17 are clustered apart form the other clusters, reflecting their somewhat isolated position in the original graph. Similarly, Actor 12 only maintains one connection to Mr. H, and is thus set far apart from the other nodes in the embedding.\nThere are many uses for graph embeddings. They allow for fast computation of node distances and can serve as effective features for graph-based classification problems.\nThis content was largely drawn from the following resources,\n Cai, H., Zheng, V.

To assess this, we conducted an exploratory analysis of peer review outcomes of 23,876 initial submissions and 7,192 full submissions that were submitted to the biosciences journal textiteLife between 2012 and 2017. Women and authors from nations outside of North America and Europe were underrepresented both as gatekeepers (editors and peer reviewers) and authors. We found evidence of a homophilic relationship between the demographics of the gatekeepers and authors and the outcome of peer review; that is, there were higher rates of acceptance in the case of gender and country homophily. The acceptance rate for manuscripts with male last authors was seven percent, or 3.5 percentage points, greater than for female last authors (95% CI = [0.5, 6.4]); this gender inequity was greatest, at nine percent or about 4.8 percentage points (95% CI = [0.3, 9.1]), when the team of reviewers was all male; this difference was smaller and not significantly different for mixed-gender reviewer teams. Homogeny between countries of the gatekeeper and the corresponding author was also associated with higher acceptance rates for many countries. To test for the persistence of these effects after controlling for potentially confounding variables, we conducted a logistic regression including document and author metadata. Disparities in acceptance rates associated with gender and country of affiliation and the homophilic associations remained. We conclude with a discussion of mechanisms that could contribute to this effect, directions for future research, and policy implications.

We investigated such disparities at the biosciences journal textiteLife by analyzing the demographics of authors and gatekeepers (editors and peer reviewers), and peer review outcomes of all submissions between 2012 and 2017. Outcomes were more favorable for male authors and those affiliated with institutions in North America and Europe; these groups were also over-represented among gatekeepers. There was evidence that peer review outcomes were influenced by textithomophily —a preference of gatekeepers for manuscripts from authors with shared characteristics.

In academia, successful researchers have been found more likely to be persistent in publishing, but little attention has been given to how persistence in maintaining collaborative relationships affects career success. This paper proposes a new bibliometric understanding of persistence that considers the prominent role of collaboration in contemporary science. Using this perspective, we analyze the relationship between persistent collaboration and publication quality along several dimensions: degree of transdisciplinarity, difference in coauthor's scientific age and their scientific impact, and research-team size. Contrary to traditional wisdom, our results show that persistent scientific collaboration does not always result in high-quality papers. We find that the most persistent transdisciplinary collaboration tends to output high-impact publications, and that those coauthors with diverse scientific impact or scientific ages benefit from persistent collaboration more than homogeneous compositions. We also find that researchers persistently working in large groups tend to publish lower-impact papers. These results contradict the colloquial understanding of collaboration in academia and paint a more nuanced picture of how persistent scientific collaboration relates to success, a picture that can provide valuable insights to researchers, funding agencies, policy makers, and mentor–mentee program directors.

We explore other “circumstances”, reflecting the composition of collaborators, that may interact with the relationship between stability and impact, and show that (1) Transdisciplinary collaborations with low stability leads to high impact publications; (2) Stable collaboration with the collaborative author pairs showing greater difference in scientific age or career impact can produce high impact publications; and (3) Highly-cited collaborators whose publications have a large number of co-authors do not keep stable collaborations.

The goal is to identify the convergence or discrepancy of countries in mobility and collaboration and determine the positions and relative influence of countries in both processes. Using affiliation data from scientific publications, we analyze the distributions and networks of collaboration and mobility and their structural differences. The results show that there is a significant relationship between the flow of mobile researchers and the capacity for publishing with foreign partners in the more prolific countries, although mobility is always lower than collaboration. Size matters and scientific relationship are highly resource-dependent. The Advanced and Proficient countries accumulate the highest proportion of the mobile authors and international publications with an extremely low representation of mobility in Developing and Lagging countries. In addition, the placement of countries is not always consistent in both networks, revealing the distinct roles, with particular instability for lower income countries. The more resources available in a country (both scientific and economic) the greater the likelihood of attracting foreign partners and mobilizing human capital. The policy relevance of these structural differences are described and a brief description of the limitations and future research are provided.","tags":["scholarly communication","international collaboration","mobility","Science Policy","Scientific capacity"],"title":"A Global Comparison of Scientific Mobility and Collaboration According to National Scientific Capacities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sanchari Das","Javon Goard","Dakota Murray"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1483228800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1483228800,"objectID":"6b6f9cb5b2c41dc0d9d8cc70b8cd2973","permalink":"/publication/das-how-2017/","publishdate":"2020-07-21T15:31:06.557498Z","relpermalink":"/publication/das-how-2017/","section":"publication","summary":"In contemporary U.S. culture celebrities compete for attention and publicize their work using social media tools. Twitter is a popular platform that celebrities use to post a variety of content, however little is known about the potency of these different types of content to draw audience attention and participation. In this paper, we outline a scheme for classifying content created by celebrity users on Twitter and analyze the audience engagement to these diverse types of tweets. We find that different types of content produce different levels of audience engagement and that a celebrity's everyday usage of Twitter (selfies, photos of travels, humour, etc.) produces the most engagement, followed by self-endorsement and commentary about society. But we also find that these patterns vary between celebrities, and audiences are not identical in their response to the content. We likewise determine that there is some other source of unexplained variation, likely resulting from Twitter's recommendation algorithms or external media coverage. As part of our study, we propose a unique coding scheme which enhances the effectiveness of inter-coder reliability, reducing the time to code.","tags":["Twitter","content analysis","audience engagement","celebrities","social media"],"title":"How Celebrities Feed Tweeples with Personal and Promotional Tweets: Celebrity Twitter Use and Audience Engagement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cassidy R.
