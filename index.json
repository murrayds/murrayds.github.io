I wrote my dissertation. I\u0026rsquo;m Dr. Murray now. A year of pre-k. 12 years of grade school. 5 years for my undergraduate degree. 5 more for this PhD. 23 years of my life have been spent in school! It\u0026rsquo;s a strange, scary, and exhilarating feeling to have finally reached the zenith of this long experience, and to stare into the distance ahead, wondering what\u0026rsquo;s next. The next steps, however, will have to wait. First, I want to catch my breath and look back at this latest achievement.\nI titled my dissertation Embracing Complexity in the Science of Science. Its a \u0026ldquo;stapled\u0026rdquo; dissertation format, merging 4 studies that I wrote while in grad school. The narrative thread I chose to connect each study was to look at science through the perspective of Complexity Science, considering how treating science as a complex system might inform us about its inner workings. You can read it here, if you want (its quite long). If you\u0026rsquo;re more of a visual person, you might also appreciate this presentation, which I think did a pretty good job of summarizing it.\nThe first of the four studies investigates the extent of gender and national bias in peer review, observing the role of homophilic preferences in not only shaping review decisions, but structuring the composition of teams of referees. The second study leverages public and private data to explore the factors driving student-teacher evaluations, an important but often overlooked metric in a scientist\u0026rsquo;s career; we find evidence of demographic bias, namely that women and non-White faculty are at a disadvantage in these ratings, putting them at a disadvantage in hiring, promotion, and more. The third study attempts to quantify the extent of disagreement across science, revealing that it is most common in the social sciences and humanities, and lowest in physics and maths; yet there is also a great deal of heterogeneity across sub-fields, resulting from their the physical realities of their research topic. Finally, the fourth study explores the examines the global landscape of scientific mobility, creating a dense representation of mobility that illustrates the importance of different kinds of proximities, such as geography, language, culture, shared history, and prestige, in structuring the mobility decisions of individual scientists.\nTogether, each of these studies constitutes a significant contribution to the Science of Science. Yet when viewed collectively through the perspective of complex systems, they show insights about the organization and behavior of science. For example, homophilic preferences, demographic bias, physical realities, and proximity are all examples of bottom-up forces that govern the actions and interactions of individuals, allowing them to self-organize into complex social arrangements such as teams, communities, and disciplines. Concepts like feedback, too, explain how selection mechanisms, like peer review (eLife), metric evaluations (student-teacher evaluations), peer judgements (disagreement), and hiring (mobility) naturally produce and perpetuate inequalities and hierarchies in science. Yet feedback also allows for radical change across science. The chaotic nature of science sometimes triggers feedback loops that amplify the effects of certain events, such as an individual\u0026rsquo;s success or a breakthrough discovery, to such an extreme that they remake wide swathes of science over a few short years.\nBy viewing science as a complex system, it shifts the attention of the Science of Science away from grand theories of science and universal laws, and instead towards the everyday actions and behaviors of individual scientists. By simply shifting our perspective, we can reveal something about the fundamental workings of science, and maybe even spot a path towards improving it, making it more open, equitable, and effective.\nThere are of course tons of details left in my dissertation. Writing it took a long time, many revisions, and a lot of reading! Although I have wonderful mentors who praised my work, I remain intimately familiar with all of its shortcomings. Yet finally, I am beginning to look back and appreciate the work I have produced. It will never be perfect, but it was good enough to get me to where I want to go. And I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a lot from it too. I hope to take what I learned here and do even better research moving forward, because the dissertation shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be a barrier to your career, but a stepping stone.\n","date":1629995922,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629995922,"objectID":"c1a50bbe9e834f207bcbb620380a8ba4","permalink":"/post/final-dissertation/","publishdate":"2021-08-26T12:38:42-04:00","relpermalink":"/post/final-dissertation/","section":"post","summary":"Well, I did it!

Accompanying this growth is a deluge of data on scientific activity and advancements in computational techniques that open new avenues for its analysis. Leveraging these new data and techniques, the field of Science of Science turns the tools of science upon science itself, aiming to understand its composition and behavior. While making significant contributions, the study of science remains constrained by its vastness, heterogeneity, and interconnectedness. Here, I argue that the Science of Science benefits from viewing science as a complex system, and drawing on the conceptual framework developed to understand such systems in other domains. Specifically, I detail a complexity perspective that conceptualizes science as a self-organizing system of interconnected scientists in which bottom-up interactions between individuals give way to emergent global structure and behavior. I demonstrate the value of this perspective by using it to interpret four studies covering diverse topics in Science of Science: bias in peer review, prejudice in teaching evaluations of university faculty, the incidence of disagreement in science, and the landscape of global scientifc mobility. Viewing my findings through the lens of complexity, I disentangle the forces that contribute to the behavior of individual scientists and illustrate how feedback mechanisms simultaneously entrench social structures while maintaining the potential for revolutionary change. This perspective also reveals how the inherent complexity of science poses challenges for its study, confounding attempts at objective measurement. Finally, I argue that the complexity perspective is uniquely positioned to benefit from future advancements in data availability and methodology and to provide further insights into the fundamental composition and behaviors of science. Embracing complexity others a promising direction for the Science of Science, with deep implications for the understanding and governance of the global scientific enterprise.","tags":["Complexity","Science of Science"],"title":"2021 Dissertation","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Wout S.

However, the extent of disagreement in science, its evolution over time, and the fields in which it happens, remains largely unknown. Leveraging a massive collection of scientific texts, we develop a cue-phrase based approach to identify instances of disagreement citations across more than four million scientific articles. Using this method, we construct an indicator of disagreement across scientific fields over the 2000-2015 period. In contrast with black-box text classification methods, our framework is transparent and easily interpretable. We reveal a disciplinary spectrum of disagreement, with higher disagreement in the social sciences and lower disagreement in physics and mathematics. However, detailed disciplinary analysis demonstrates heterogeneity across sub-fields, revealing the importance of local disciplinary cultures and epistemic characteristics of disagreement. Paper-level analysis reveals notable episodes of disagreement in science, and illustrates how methodological artefacts can confound analyses of scientific texts. These findings contribute to a broader understanding of disagreement and establish a foundation for future research to understanding key processes underlying scientific progress.","tags":["Computer Science - Computation and Language","Computer Science - Digital Libraries"],"title":"Measuring Disagreement in Science","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lili Miao","Dakota Murray","Woo-Sung Jung","Vincent Larivière","Cassidy R.

Understanding how nations build scientific capacity is therefore crucial to promote economic growth and national development. Although studies have shown that national scientific development is affected by geographic, historic, and economic factors, it remains unclear whether there are universal structures and trajectories behind national scientific development that can inform forecasting and policy making. By examining countries' scientific exportation-the publications that are internationally indexed-we reveal a three-cluster structure in the relatedness network of disciplines that underpin national scientific development and the organization of global science. Tracing the evolution of national research portfolios reveals that while nations are proceeding to more diverse research profiles individually, scientific production is increasingly specialized in global science over the past decades. We further demonstrate that the revealed disciplinary clusters inform economic development, where the number of publications in applied research centered cluster significantly predicts economic growth. By uncovering the underlying structure of scientific development and connecting it with economic development, our results may offer a new perspective to study national scientific development and its relationships with economic development.","tags":["Computer Science - Social and Information Networks"],"title":"The Latent Structure of National Scientific Development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jacqueline Brown","Dakota Murray","Kyle Furlong","Emily Coco","Fabian Dablander"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1612137600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1612137600,"objectID":"395d274748cf524ebc9a5c9c1beee2ac","permalink":"/publication/brown-breeding-pool-ideas-2021-a/","publishdate":"2021-08-26T16:13:22.760773Z","relpermalink":"/publication/brown-breeding-pool-ideas-2021-a/","section":"publication","summary":"Interdisciplinary research is essential for the study of complex systems, and so there is a growing need to understand the factors that facilitate collaboration across diverse fields of inquiry. In this exploratory study, we examine the composition of self-organized project groups and the structure of collaboration networks at the Santa Fe Institute's Complex Systems Summer School. Using data from all iterations of the summer school from 2005 to 2019, comprising 823 participants and 322 projects, we investigate the factors that contribute to group composition. We first test for homophily with respect to individual-level attributes, finding that group composition is largely consistent with random mixing based on gender, career position, institutional prestige, and country of study. However, we find some evidence of homophilic preference in group composition based on disciplinary background. We then conduct analyses at the level of group projects, finding that project topics from the Social and Behavioral Sciences are over-represented. This could be due to a higher level of baseline interest in, or knowledge of, social and behavioral sciences, or the common application of methods from the natural sciences to problems in the social sciences. Consequently, future research should explore this discrepancy further and examine whether it can be mitigated through policies aimed at making topics in other disciplines more accessible or appealing for collaboration.","tags":["Centrality","Complex systems","Mathematical models","Physical sciences","Schools","Scientists","Social sciences","Statistics"],"title":"A Breeding Pool of Ideas: Analyzing Interdisciplinary Collaborations at the Complex Systems Summer School","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1610935851,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610935851,"objectID":"b4f19727ec6285069a594d7df6b55780","permalink":"/talk/2021-copenhagen/","publishdate":"2021-01-17T21:10:51-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2021-copenhagen/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"2021 Copenhagen","type":"talk"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1610124471,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610124471,"objectID":"a65f15f67b8419752017bcc3aa2f78d8","permalink":"/talk/2021-northwestern/","publishdate":"2021-01-08T11:47:51-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2021-northwestern/","section":"talk","summary":"Evaluation in science, whether per review, performance metrics, or networks of peer-to-peer judgements, determines who stays, who leaves, and what work is rewarded in science. Ideally, a researcher should be evaluated based on their true merit, but evaluation is subjective, and deeply embedded in a particular social, political, and cultural context. In my research, I explore what social and contextual factors relate to evaluation in science. I conduct four studies examining different areas of evaluation. The first study, focusing on peer review, examines the extent to which gender and national bias persist in journal peer review at eLife. The next studies investigate how bias and contextual factors shape two very different kinds of performance metrics: the first examines how demographic factors such as gender and ethnicity relate to student evaluations of teachers, whereas the latter explores how the use of disagreement citations differs across fields, and how this might necessitate more nuanced understandings of citation-based metrics. Finally, I turn towards evaluative networks; specifically, I focus on how networks of mobility, which are both driven by evaluation, and can drive a researcher's future success, are not equally available to everyone. I use a neural embedding technique to encode millions of researcher's individual trajectories into a vector-space representation which, when interrogated, reveals the importance of geography, language, culture, prestige, and more, in structuring global mobility, and thus the options available to individual researchers. Together, these studies paint a picture of how social and contextual factors shape evaluation, and therefore success, in science. Changes to policies and practices are necessary to remedy these issues and promote holistic evaluation, and to create a more equitable, open, and effective system of science.","tags":[],"title":"2021 Northwestern","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Dakota Murray"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1608071492,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1608071492,"objectID":"511deb46915b64b588573ce5f524bce9","permalink":"/talk/2020-northeastern/","publishdate":"2020-12-15T17:31:32-05:00","relpermalink":"/talk/2020-northeastern/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Job"],"title":"2021 Northeastern","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Dakota Murray","Jisung Yoon","Sadamori Kojaku","Rodrigo Costas","Woo-Sung Jung","Staša Milojević","Yong-Yeol Ahn"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1606780800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1606780800,"objectID":"8945c1c78eb1d0aa0fb95dceffeda3a6","permalink":"/publication/murray-unsupervised-embedding-trajectories-2020/","publishdate":"2021-08-26T16:13:22.766458Z","relpermalink":"/publication/murray-unsupervised-embedding-trajectories-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Human mobility and migration drive major societal phenomena such as the growth and evolution of cities, epidemics, economies, and innovation. Historically, human mobility has been strongly constrained by physical separation -- geographic distance. However, geographic distance is becoming less relevant in the increasingly-globalized world in which physical barriers are shrinking while linguistic, cultural, and historical relationships are becoming more important. As understanding mobility is becoming critical for contemporary society, finding frameworks that can capture this complexity is of paramount importance. Here, using three distinct human trajectory datasets, we demonstrate that a neural embedding model can encode nuanced relationships between locations into a vector-space, providing an effective measure of distance that reflects the multi-faceted structure of human mobility. Focusing on the case of scientific mobility, we show that embeddings of scientific organizations uncover cultural and linguistic relations, and even academic prestige, at multiple levels of granularity. Furthermore, the embedding vectors reveal universal relationships between organizational characteristics and their place in the global landscape of scientific mobility. The ability to learn scalable, dense, and meaningful representations of mobility directly from the data can open up a new avenue of studying mobility across domains.","tags":["Computer Science - Machine Learning","Physics - Physics and Society"],"title":"Unsupervised Embedding of Trajectories Captures the Latent Structure of Mobility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dakota Murray","Wout Lamers","Vincent Lariviére","Kevin Boyack","Cassidy R.

However, in the crowded arena of online platforms, it is increasingly important for scientists to present their findings in a manner that appears credible, especially considering the heightened opportunity for the misunderstandings surrounding scientific topics, such as climate change. To examine the extent to which the online presentation of science information relates to its perceived credibility, we designed and conducted two surveys on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. In the first survey, participants rated the credibility of science information on Twitter compared with the same information other platforms, and in the second, participants rated the credibility of tweets with modified characteristics: presence of an image, text sentiment, number of likes/retweets. We found that that the same information about scientific findings was generally found less credible when presented on Twitter than on other platforms. However, there is evidence that even within Twitter, the inclusion of recognizable features of Scientific work, such as figures, the paper abstract, and the use of the paper title, may be related to increased credibility on Twitter. A clear understanding of features that contribute to and detract from credibility on a platform as widely distrusted as Twitter may allow researchers who regularly use Twitter for research-related networking and communication to present their findings in the most credible formats.","tags":null,"title":"Credibility of Scientific Information on Social Media: Variation by Platform and Presence of Formal Credibility Cues","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dakota Murray","Clara Boothby","Huimeng Zhao","Vanessa Minik","Nicolas Bérubé","Vincent Larivière","Cassidy R.

Moreover, in spite of the idealistic assumption that research and teaching are mutually beneficial, few studies have examined the link between research performance and student evaluations of teaching. In this study, we conduct a large scale exploratory analysis of the factors associated with student evaluations of teachers, controlling for heterogeneous institutional and disciplinary contexts. We source public student evaluations of teaching from RateMyProfessor.com and information regarding career and contemporary research performance indicators from the company Academic Analytics. The factors most associated with higher student ratings were the attractiveness of the faculty and the student's interest in the class; the factors most associated with lower student ratings were course difficulty and whether student comments mentioned an accent or a teaching assistant. Moreover, faculty tended to be rated more highly when they were young, male, White, in the Humanities, and held a rank of full professor. We observed little to no evidence of any relationship, positive or negative, between student evaluations of teaching and research performance. These results shed light on what factors relate to student evaluations of teaching across diverse contexts and contribute to the continuing discussion teaching evaluation and faculty assessment.","tags":["Bibliometrics","Careers","Citation analysis","Engineering and technology","Instructors","Social sciences","Teachers","Universities"],"title":"Exploring the Personal and Professional Factors Associated with Student Evaluations of Tenure-Track Faculty","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dakota Murray"],"categories":[],"content":"Graph laplacian eigenmaps (GLE) are one means, among many, of embedding graphs into a low-dimensional numeric space. Specifically, GLE is an approach based on Matrix Factorization that takes as input non-relational data and outputs node embeddings. The key insight of GLEs is that the graph property to be preserved can be interpreted as pairwise node similarities. Thus, a larger penalty is imposed if two nodes with large similarity are embedded far apart. Thus, the goal of this approach is to find an embedding that minimizes this penalty.\nThe gist of this approach is that it aims to first represent the graph as a Graph Laplacian Matrix, $L$. $L$ is a means of representing a graph in matrix form following the definition $L = D - W$, where $D$ is the degree matrix, a diagonal matrix containing the degree of each node, and $W$ is the adjacency matrix of weights. Under this representation, all positive values correspond to degrees of the node, and all negative values to the weights of the edges. We then perform a decomposition on $L$ to find its eigenvalues. The eigenvectors corresponding to the smallest of the eigenvalues are used as the embedding.\nThe optimal embedding, $y^{\\ast}$ can be derived from the following objective function,\n$$y^{\\ast} = \\text{argmin}_{y} \\sum_{i\\neq j} (y_{i} - y_{j}^{2} W_{ij}) = \\text{argmin}_{y} y^{T}Ly$$\nWhere $W_{ij}$ is the similarity matrix between every pair of nodes $v_{i}$ and $v_{j}$. $L$ is the graph laplacian matrix, $D$ is the diagonal matrix for which $D_{ii} = \\sum_{i \\neq j}W_{ij}$.\nThe goal of this objective function is to find the embedding, $y^{\\ast}$ that minimizes the error compared to the Graph Laplacian Matrix, $L$. One benefit of representing a graph with $L$ rather than a simple adjacency matrix is that the diagonal will contain the degrees of the graph; the larger the degree of a node, the more that its row will be \u0026ldquo;weighted\u0026rdquo; when computing the objective function. The practical effect is that larger degree nodes will have a greater impact on the embedding than lower-degree nodes.\nThere are several expansions on this basic optimization, but in each of these variants, the optimal embedding $y^{\\prime}$ are the eigenvectors of the laplacian matrix, $\\lambda$, which can be calculated by solving the the eigenproblem $Wy = \\lambda Dy$.\nArrange the eigenvalues from smallest to largest. The first eigenvalue should be close to zero, and its corresponding eigenvector is not typically used for embedding. Rather, use the remaining eigenvalues and their corresponding eigenvectors to construct the $d$-dimensional embedding. For example, a 3-dimensional embedding can be constructed using the eigenvectors corresponding to the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th smallest eigenvalues. A 2-dimensional embedding can be constructed using the eigenvectors of the 2nd and 3rd smallest eigenvalues.\nLets walk through this process in R.\nConsider the Karate network, shown below, which is a popular network exemplifying community structure.\nHaving loaded this data into R, we can construct the Graph Laplacian Matrix, $L$, from the adjacency matrix $W$ and the degree matrix, $D$.\nW \u0026lt;- as.matrix(as.matrix.network(karate)) D \u0026lt;- diag(rowSums(W)) L \u0026lt;- D - W  Then, we can solve the eigenproblem $Wy = \\lambda Dy$ and select the eigenvectors corresponding to the 2nd and 3rd smallest eigenvectors to produce an embedding.\neig \u0026lt;- eigen(L, D) col_dim \u0026lt;- dim(eig$vectors)[1] vectors \u0026lt;- eig$vectors[,(col_dim - 1):(col_dim - 2)]  The resulting embedding is shown below.\nWe can see that much of the structure from the original graph also appears in the embedding. As with the network, the embedding demonstrates a clear division between the two communities. Additionally, we see all the nodes that are directly connected to the opposing community are clustered together. Meanwhile, nodes for Actor 5, 6, 7, 11, and 17 are clustered apart form the other clusters, reflecting their somewhat isolated position in the original graph. Similarly, Actor 12 only maintains one connection to Mr. H, and is thus set far apart from the other nodes in the embedding.\nThere are many uses for graph embeddings. They allow for fast computation of node distances and can serve as effective features for graph-based classification problems.\nThis content was largely drawn from the following resources,\n Cai, H., Zheng, V.

To assess this, we conducted an exploratory analysis of peer review outcomes of 23,876 initial submissions and 7,192 full submissions that were submitted to the biosciences journal eLife between 2012 and 2017. Women and authors from nations outside of North America and Europe were underrepresented both as gatekeepers (editors and peer reviewers) and authors. We found evidence of a homophilic relationship between the demographics of the gatekeepers and authors and the outcome of peer review; that is, there were higher rates of acceptance in the case of gender and country homophily. The acceptance rate for manuscripts with male last authors was seven percent, or 3.5 percentage points, greater than for female last authors (95% CI = [0.5, 6.4]); this gender inequity was greatest, at nine percent or about 4.8 percentage points (95% CI = [0.3, 9.1]), when the team of reviewers was all male; this difference was smaller and not significantly different for mixed-gender reviewer teams. Homogeny between countries of the gatekeeper and the corresponding author was also associated with higher acceptance rates for many countries. To test for the persistence of these effects after controlling for potentially confounding variables, we conducted a logistic regression including document and author metadata. Disparities in acceptance rates associated with gender and country of affiliation and the homophilic associations remained. We conclude with a discussion of mechanisms that could contribute to this effect, directions for future research, and policy implications.

We identify nearly 16 million individual authors from publications covered in the Web of Science for the 2008– 2015 period. Based on the information provided across individuals' publication records, we propose a general classification for analyzing scientific mobility using institutional affiliation changes. We distinguish between migrants--authors who have ruptures with their country of origin--and travelers--authors who gain additional affiliations while maintaining affiliation with their country of origin. We find that 3.7% of researchers who have published at least one paper over the period are mobile. Travelers represent 72.7% of all mobile scholars, but migrants have higher scientific impact. We apply this classification at the country level, expanding the classification to incorporate the directionality of scientists' mobility (i.e., incoming and outgoing). We provide a brief analysis to highlight the utility of the proposed taxonomy to study scholarly mobility and discuss the implications for science policy.","tags":["bibliometrics","Bibliometrics","Brain circulation","Brain drain","complex","International mobility","methods","mobility","Science policy","Scientific mobility"],"title":"The Many Faces of Mobility: Using Bibliometric Data to Measure the Movement of Scientists","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Nicolas Robinson-Garcia","Cassidy R.

In academia, successful researchers have been found more likely to be persistent in publishing, but little attention has been given to how persistence in maintaining collaborative relationships affects career success. This paper proposes a new bibliometric understanding of persistence that considers the prominent role of collaboration in contemporary science. Using this perspective, we analyze the relationship between persistent collaboration and publication quality along several dimensions: degree of transdisciplinarity, difference in coauthor's scientific age and their scientific impact, and research-team size. Contrary to traditional wisdom, our results show that persistent scientific collaboration does not always result in high-quality papers. We find that the most persistent transdisciplinary collaboration tends to output high-impact publications, and that those coauthors with diverse scientific impact or scientific ages benefit from persistent collaboration more than homogeneous compositions. We also find that researchers persistently working in large groups tend to publish lower-impact papers. These results contradict the colloquial understanding of collaboration in academia and paint a more nuanced picture of how persistent scientific collaboration relates to success, a picture that can provide valuable insights to researchers, funding agencies, policy makers, and mentor– mentee program directors. Moreover, the methodology in this study showcases a feasible approach to measure persistent collaboration.","tags":null,"title":"Understanding Persistent Scientific Collaboration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yi Bu","Dakota S.

In regards to scientific collaborations, we define stability to reflect the consistent investment of a certain amount of effort into a relationship. In this paper, we provide an explicit definition of a new indicator of stability, based on the year-to-year publication output of collaborations. We conduct a large-scale analysis of stability among collaborations between authors publishing in the field of computer science. Collaborations with medium– high degree of stability tend to occur most frequently, and on average, have the highest average scientific impact. We explore other ``circumstances'', reflecting the composition of collaborators, that may interact with the relationship between stability and impact, and show that (1) Transdisciplinary collaborations with low stability leads to high impact publications; (2) Stable collaboration with the collaborative author pairs showing greater difference in scientific age or career impact can produce high impact publications; and (3) Highly-cited collaborators whose publications have a large number of co-authors do not keep stable collaborations. We also demonstrate how our indicator for stability can be used alongside other similar indicators, such as persistence, to better understand the nature of scientific collaboration, and outline a new taxonomy of collaborations.","tags":["62P25","O35","Persistence","Scientific collaboration","Scientometrics","Stability"],"title":"Measuring the Stability of Scientific Collaboration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zaida Chinchilla-Rodríguez","Lili Miao","Dakota Murray","Nicolás Robinson-Garciá","Rodrigo Costas","Cassidy R.

The goal is to identify the convergence or discrepancy of countries in mobility and collaboration and determine the positions and relative influence of countries in both processes. Using affiliation data from scientific publications, we analyze the distributions and networks of collaboration and mobility and their structural differences. The results show that there is a significant relationship between the flow of mobile researchers and the capacity for publishing with foreign partners in the more prolific countries, although mobility is always lower than collaboration. Size matters and scientific relationship are highly resource-dependent. The Advanced and Proficient countries accumulate the highest proportion of the mobile authors and international publications with an extremely low representation of mobility in Developing and Lagging countries. In addition, the placement of countries is not always consistent in both networks, revealing the distinct roles, with particular instability for lower income countries. The more resources available in a country (both scientific and economic) the greater the likelihood of attracting foreign partners and mobilizing human capital. The policy relevance of these structural differences are described and a brief description of the limitations and future research are provided.","tags":["international collaboration","mobility","scholarly communication","Science Policy","Scientific capacity"],"title":"A Global Comparison of Scientific Mobility and Collaboration According to National Scientific Capacities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cassidy R.

Twitter is a popular platform that celebrities use to post a variety of content, however little is known about the potency of these different types of content to draw audience attention and participation. In this paper, we outline a scheme for classifying content created by celebrity users on Twitter and analyze the audience engagement to these diverse types of tweets. We find that different types of content produce different levels of audience engagement and that a celebrity's everyday usage of Twitter (selfies, photos of travels, humour, etc.) produces the most engagement, followed by self-endorsement and commentary about society. But we also find that these patterns vary between celebrities, and audiences are not identical in their response to the content. We likewise determine that there is some other source of unexplained variation, likely resulting from Twitter's recommendation algorithms or external media coverage. As part of our study, we propose a unique coding scheme which enhances the effectiveness of inter-coder reliability, reducing the time to code.","tags":["audience engagement","celebrities","content analysis","social media","Twitter"],"title":"How Celebrities Feed Tweeples with Personal and Promotional Tweets: Celebrity Twitter Use and Audience Engagement","type":"publication"}]
