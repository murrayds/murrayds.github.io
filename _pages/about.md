I study the *human* side of discovery, with the hope of understanding and improving science. I often make use of massive datasets, computational techniques, and social theory. So far, my work has touched on disagreement, institutional mobility, bias in science, and more.

Right now, I am a research assistant professor at the [Network Science Institute](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/) at Northeastern Univeristy. 


Currently, I am a Data Scientist at Digital Science, where I deliver analysis and insights directly to science policy makers around the world.

Previously, I worked as a Data Scientist with [Digital Science](https://www.digital-science.com/) to develop tools and deliver analysis to support decision making in funding agencies. I was also postdoctoral research associate working at the [Center for Complex Network Research](https://www.barabasilab.com/) with [Albert-László Barabási](https://barabasi.com/). I studied for my Ph.D in [Informatics](https://luddy.indiana.edu/) at Indiana University Bloomington, where I wrote my dissertation [“Embracing Complexity in the Science of Science”](https://www.proquest.com/openview/cefaab26feeac12caf6e99de6bd3d76c/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) under the amazing mentorship of Dr. [Cassidy Sugimoto](https://spp.gatech.edu/people/person/2815f752-35cb-5607-a294-bc3ad6645390) and Dr. [Yong-Yeol Ahn](https://yongyeol.com/). I am also an alumni of the Santa Fe Institute's Complex Systems Summer School.

When not working, I enjoy running, cooking, traveling, reading (especially science fiction), and spending time with my wonderful wife and daughter.
