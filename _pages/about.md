I study the *human* side of science, and in the process often make use of massive datasets, computational techniques, and social theory. So far, my work has touched on disagreement, institutional mobility, and bias in science.

Currently, I am a postdoctoral research associate working at the [Center for Complex Network Research](https://www.barabasilab.com/) with [Albert-László Barabási](https://barabasi.com/).

Previously, I studied for my Ph.D in [Informatics](https://luddy.indiana.edu/) at Indiana University Bloomington, where I wrote my dissertation [“Embracing Complexity in the Science of Science”](https://www.proquest.com/openview/cefaab26feeac12caf6e99de6bd3d76c/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y) under the amazing mentorship of Dr. [Cassidy Sugimoto](https://spp.gatech.edu/people/person/2815f752-35cb-5607-a294-bc3ad6645390) and Dr. [Yong-Yeol Ahn](https://yongyeol.com/). I am also an alumni of the Santa Fe Institute's Complex Systems Summer School.

When not working, I enjoy running, cooking, traveling, reading (especially science fiction), and spending time with my wonderful wife and daughter.
